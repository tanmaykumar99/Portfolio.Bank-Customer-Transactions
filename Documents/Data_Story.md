- The bulk of high-risk anomalous transactions concentrates in Mumbai and New Delhi, with **Bengaluru showing a notable share of critical flagged transactions** deserving focused attention.  
- Unusual patterns arise primarily during **evening and late-night hours**, suggesting temporal fraud vulnerability periods.
- The age group of 60+ observes the largest share of customers flagged with anomalous transactions w.r.t to their customer base at a whopping **~8%**, indicating that senior citizens may possibly be the victims of targeted fraud attacks and phishing attempts.

## Real-World Growth & Revenue Solutions (Expanded)

### A. Customer-Centric Marketing

- **Target High-Value Segments:**  
  The analysis clearly identifies **Champions** and **Elite** groups as the primary contributors to the bank’s revenue, characterised by high transaction frequency and substantial monetary value.

  Customers identified as "At Risk" or "Needs Attention" exhibit declining transaction activity and lower balances. These segments are vulnerable to churn, posing revenue risk totalling upto **₹217Mn** in losses.
  - **Churn Prediction Modelling:** Use predictive analytics to identify early warning signs within these segments, such as decreased transaction frequency or anomaly scores.  
  - **Targeted Retention Campaigns:** Roll out reactivation offers, financial health check-ups, and tailored product recommendations to re-engage these customers.  
  - **Personal Outreach:** Use direct communication channels (calls, SMS, email) with personalised messages addressing their specific needs and concerns.

  The bank’s demographic mix shows a dominant 26-35 age group and a gender skew towards males (~69%), but with females showing slightly higher median transaction values.

- **Timing-Optimised Engagement:**  
  Transaction peaks on weekends and evenings (4:30 PM – 9:30 PM) suggest optimal interaction windows.  
  - Schedule marketing campaigns, promotional offers, and push notifications (possibly by making use of Clevertap's **RenderMax©**) during these high engagement periods to maximise visibility and uptake.  
  - Align customer service availability and chatbot hours to peak transaction times for enhanced support and frictionless customer experience.  
  - Conversely, schedule system updates and backend maintenance during low-activity periods like late nights to minimise customer impact.

### B. Operational & Fraud Risk Mitigation

- **Enhanced Anomaly Detection:**  
  The fraud risk model identifies anomalous transactions by features like transaction amount relative to location (`AmountZScoreByLocation`), timing patterns, and frequency spikes. Bengaluru, notably, shows elevated critical transaction counts.  
  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Integrate these risk features into a real-time fraud detection engine to flag high-priority alerts instantaneously for manual review.  
  - **Focused Surveillance:** Deploy enhanced customer monitoring in Bengaluru first, leveraging geospatial and behavioural data to tighten control over anomalous activities.  
  - **Adaptive Risk Scoring:** Continuously update risk models with new transaction patterns to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

- **Fraud Prevention Campaigns:**  
  Customer education targeted at recognising suspicious transaction patterns, emphasising risks in evening and late-night hours where anomalies surface more frequently.  
  - Develop clear communication materials and in-app alerts to raise awareness of fraud risks during vulnerable periods.
  - Engage customers with multi-factor authentication and behavioural biometrics during high-risk time windows.
  - Temporarily block a transaction with an unnaturally high amount for a given Customer ID with no such history, only allowing the transaction to pass through after verification through a phone call or an e-mail.

- **Data-Driven Audit Trails:**  
  Use anomaly metrics, Z-scores, and segment-level risk scores to prioritise audits and compliance efforts.  
  - Focus regulatory scrutiny and internal resources on segments and locations with a history of higher fraud detections.  
  - Automate suspicious transaction reporting through data pipelines linked to compliance dashboards.

- **Dynamic Pricing & Offers:**  
  Timing and transaction amount trends enable launching **time-sensitive promotions** such as cash-back during off-peak periods, festive offers, or loan discounts tied to transaction behaviours.  
  - Use Machine Learning models such as **Gradient Boosting for prediction, Multi-armed bandits for personalisation** to train pricing models, so as to personalise interest rates and fees per segment, increasing uptake and satisfaction.

- **Geographical Expansion:**  
  Concentrate branch expansions, digital channel investments, and local marketing in transaction-rich neighbourhoods like **Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Gurgaon, and Delhi district**.  
  - Tailor product accessibility—such as regional language support (Kannada, Hindi, Marathi) or location-specific financial products.
