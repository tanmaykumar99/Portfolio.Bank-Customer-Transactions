# Bank Customer Transaction Analysis Datasets

This repository contains multiple datasets used for/derived from the Bank Customer Transactions Analysis project.
They are categorized into **Raw Data**, **SQL Exports**, and **Python Processed Exports**.

The primary reason for uploading the datasets on Kaggle instead of direct upload to repo directory was to avoid any slow processing or backlogs while cloning the repository in the future, as the combined size of all the relevant csv files was ~300MB.
